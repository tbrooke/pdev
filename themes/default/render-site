ideas and values. The children will be working and playing under the guidance of Christian leadership."

EXCEPTIONS. The late fee will not exceed the sum of twenty dollars ($20.00).
If a check for the tuition is returned for any reason, then subsequent tuition payments will be accepted
only by cash, money order or certified funds. In addition, a service charge of $10.00 will be due and payable
immediately. If the tuition payment is past due for 30 days or the late fee is not paid within the month due, or
the service charge for a refund check is not paid immediately, then the student may be asked to withdraw.
If a child’s tuition is not paid for the month, the child will NOT be allowed to attend the following month.

Health

Please notify the teachers if your child develops a contagious disease. We will also attempt to inform
families of infectious sicknesses that your child may come in contact with while at Preschool. We ask that you
do not send your child to school with a fever. Your child may return to school following a 24-hour period that is
symptom free and fever free.

Student Medication

Medications should be administered at home.

Insurance

A limited accident coverage is provided for your child while attending Mt. Zion’s Preschool.

Safety and Emergency Plans

Our exterior doors remain locked at all times other than the front entrance to the preschool. This door
will be open at 8:30 when drop off begins and locked at 9:15. Our staff is trained in CPR and First Aid. We
have emergency plans for fire, tornado, and other safety issues. There will be practice drills for each class and
discussions held on safety when learning opportunities arise. Feel free to speak to your child’s teacher or the
director if you have questions.

Supplies

There are many supplies that parents can help provide throughout the year. Monetary contributions are
always helpful and may be made through the church or the preschool. You will receive a letter acknowledging
your contribution. We always need baby wipes, liquid hand soap, Kleenex, paper plates, plastic spoons and
forks, napkins, 5 oz. kitchen cups, nutritious snacks, paper towels, glue sticks, hand sanitizer, dish detergent,
Windex, Lysol and Lysol spray and Ziploc bags (gallon and snack sizes). We love donations!

Appropriate Clothing

1) Comfortable clothing that is suitable for play. Please keep this in mind when dressing your child.
2) Tennis shoes or sturdy shoes. NO flip flops or sandals please!
3) Outer clothing suitable to the outside weather.
4) Label all items (clothes [coats and sweaters], and lunchbox) with your child’s name.

3

5) Send a complete change of clothes to school (include socks and underwear). We will keep these
clothes in a labeled box provided by the school. REMEMBER TO KEEP THE CLOTHES
SEASONAL! These clothes will be sent home at the end of the school year.
6) Please provide pull-ups or diapers for any preschooler still requiring these.
7) Please do not allow your child to bring a pacifier to school.
Lunchbox and Bookbag

Occasionally your child will need a lunchbox. Please be sure that it is labeled with their name. We may
ask you to pack a lunch for trips or special days. Bookbags are NOT necessary.

Withdrawal Policy

In the event that you withdraw your child from preschool, and we hope you never do, please be
courteous and give our staff a minimum of a two-week notice. This will give our staff ample time to fill the
available opening.

Child Dismissal Policy

Mt. Zion UCC Preschool reserves the right to dismiss a student. Dismissing a child from our preschool
is a situation we hope will never arise. If a child’s dismissal becomes necessary, this will be handled with
discretion by the teachers and pastor in consultation with the preschool committee.

Traffic Flow

To help with traffic flow at our preschool, please enter the parking lot by way of Eudy Road, drive
behind the church and then park. Please do not enter the preschool parking lot directly from Highway 29-A.
This traffic pattern makes leaving the parking lot so much safer. Please insist that your child hold your hand in
the parking lot. We know that it is very busy!

Handicapped Parking

Please do not park in the handicapped parking places unless you possess an official handicapped tag
or you are one of our grandparents. Occasionally, these spaces will be occupied by the church vans. This is
where we will load and unload the preschoolers for field trips as we feel this is the safest place.

Hours of Operation
Arrival - All children will arrive between 8:30 AM and 9:00 AM.
Dismissal - 2- and 3-Year Old Classes will leave between 11:45 AM to 12:00 PM.
4-Year Old Classes will leave between 12:00 PM to 12:10 PM.

Arrival and Departure

You may park in any lot that you feel is convenient for accessing the exterior door of your child’s
classroom. Be sure you are following the correct traffic flow pattern. The doors are locked at 9:00 AM and
unlocked at 11:45 AM.
Please try your best to bring and pick up on time each day. Your child and the teacher will appreciate
your promptness and courtesy. At the first offense of late pickup, you will receive a warning letter. Second
offense and additional ones will receive a $25 fine. We appreciate your donations to our playground mulch
fund!
You are responsible for leaving and picking up your child from his/her classroom. Your child’s papers
will be in his/her designated place at the close of each day/week. Please wait outside the classroom door until
your child is dismissed. If your child is riding home with someone besides the usual person, please let us
know. All approved people for pickup should be listed on our safety cards. If there is someone that definitely
should not pick up your child, we will have received this information on our safety cards as well.

Weather Policy

We will follow the Rowan-Salisbury School’s decision on snow days. If school is delayed one hour, we
will delay as well. If RSS is delayed two or three hours, we will cancel. If school is cancelled, we will be
cancelled also. If RSS alters their schedule due to extreme cold, we may not follow their decision. Please

4

watch for an email and updates on the Mt. Zion Facebook page. Do not ever bring your children to
preschool if you do not feel you can travel safely.
Birthdays

We are asking you to provide a special snack on your child’s birthday or a day very close to it. This
may be dropped off in the morning. Please check with your child’s teacher and/or the monthly calendar for your
child’s assigned day. Summer birthdays will be celebrated during the school year.

Field Trips

Field trips, mostly for 3’s and 4’s, are an asset to our program’s curriculum. Our tuition does not cover
field trip expenses and our families will be responsible for field trip costs. This will include not only the
expenses for your preschooler, but also the expenses for any adult who chooses to accompany the preschool
on the field trip. Some of our trips will be for the children only, due to space constraints. Have your child wear
his/her Mt. Zion Preschool Purple T-shirt on field trip days. The Mt. Zion Preschool children’s T-shirts will cost
$10.00 each.

Communication

The Preschool will inform you regularly of upcoming events through monthly newsletters as well as
reminder notes. These will be sent on paper and email. PLEASE read any correspondence from us!
Anyone wishing to speak with the teachers throughout the year may schedule a conference or contact the
teachers. We are happy to discuss your child’s preschool days.
Snacks

The Preschool will be providing healthy snacks along with water each day. If we serve juice, it will be
served half and half (half juice and half water).
We would be thrilled anytime you wish to provide snacks or juice. Be sure and send enough for your
child’s class or more. We are asking that you choose nutritious snacks. Suggestions: pretzels, rice cakes,
saltine crackers, cheese nips, Chex mix, Goldfish crackers, yogurt, animal cookies, cereals low in sugar,
cheese, raisins, carrots and fruits (especially apples, oranges, bananas and grapes).

Scholastic Book Orders

We will be sending home book orders for you to order from. Ordering is optional, but provides you with
an opportunity to order materials for your child at an affordable price with no shipping fees. Our preschool
receives free materials when families order. Online ordering is preferred, but order forms may be filled out and
returned to the director as well. If ordering online, you will need our code LTCGD. Orders are always
placed at the end of the month and sometimes on the 15 th . Thanks for your participation!

Stories to Go

In partnership with the Rowan Public Library, your child (3’s and 4’s) will attend story time and be able
to check out 2 books from the Stories to Go van. Please keep up with these books and the bag we send them
in. If a child has not returned the books, they will NOT be allowed to check out more (library policy). This is
devastating to them! We’ll send plenty of reminders to help you keep up with the visits.

Chapel

Once a month, our 3 and 4 year olds will attend a chapel service in our sanctuary. Our Pastor will
share a brief lesson on Bible stories or holiday themes. We think it is a great opportunity to become familiar
with our beautiful worship space, our pastor, and classic Bible stories.

Soccer

Our preschool has a soccer program offered for 3’s and 4’s called Mighty Kicks. This is separate from
the preschool and is owned and operated by Justin Buckwalter. Please communicate with him regarding
soccer. If you are a part of the program, you will receive emails from him. Please note that these are emails
that our teachers do not receive. His contact info is 704-754-6286 or Justin@MightyKicks.net
